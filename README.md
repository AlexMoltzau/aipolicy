# National Artificial Intelligence Strategies

This repository was made for gathering, sharing and analysing different national strategies in the field of artificial intelligence (AI).

There are efforts to gather policy documents in the field of AI and sharing these.

A few such examples:
- OECD AI Policy Observatory: https://oecd.ai/
- AI Government Readiness Index: https://www.oxfordinsights.com/government-ai-readiness-index-2020

This repository is currently created as a personal project to begin exploring policy documents from different states or regions relating to the field of AI. 

The current focus is exploring narratives (or lack thereof) pertaining to environmental policy, sustainability and the climate crisis within these various documents and regions.

I have currently gathered together various documents in a Google Doc folder, but I aim to work with these documents to make various descriptions of the data or different text corpora.

The current documents and early efforts can be found here:
