# National Artificial Intelligence Strategies

This repository was made for gathering, sharing and analysing different national strategies in the field of artificial intelligence (AI).

There are efforts to gather policy documents in the field of AI and sharing these.

You can find a few such examples here:
- OECD AI Policy Observatory: https://oecd.ai/
- Oxford AI Government Readiness Index: https://www.oxfordinsights.com/government-ai-readiness-index-2020

It must be said that most of these sources often link to the various documents and do not have policy documents gathered in an easily accesible format to replicate their results. That is what I have found personally, and I may be wrong (please tell me if I am). 

It must be said that the Oxford AI Government Readiness Index has published a dataset on GitHub, although this is mainly oriented towards their coding of the data:

OECD.ai (2021) has, at the time of writing, displayed on their website: *"...a live repository of over 600 AI policy initiatives from 60 countries, territories and the EU. Click on a country/territory, a policy instrument or a group targeted by the policy."* They have a page where they quantify the 205 national strategies, agendas and plans they have found so far:

In addition to this they have a section for metrics & methods:

These efforts of the aforementioned organisations are highly appreciated and makes it possible to navigate policies and efforts from different countries or regions. One possibility for this project could be to get access to the documents and construct this as a seperate dataset.

This repository is currently created as a personal project to begin exploring policy documents from different states or regions relating to the field of AI. 

The current focus is exploring narratives (or lack thereof) pertaining to environmental policy, sustainability and the climate crisis within these various documents and regions.

I have currently gathered together various documents in a Google Doc folder, but I aim to work with these documents to make various descriptions of the data or different text corpora.

The current documents and early efforts can be found here:

I will work to restructure these in an accesible format.

## First thoughts about limitations
- Gathering policies relating to AI may not give an accurate picture of the overall policy framework within a government. There are often various interconnected strategic initiatives. What is interesting with for example OECD.ai is that they attempt to do this to some extent by listing initiatives relating to the field of artificial intelligence in given states, as such a somewhat broader picture may be presented.
- Analysing policy documents may not enable an understanding of the overall discussion in each country, as there may be regional semantic differences in how certain words are framed. National strategies may also link to other pertinent policy discussions in a given country, and more context would be required.
- Gathering a medium to large corpora of policy documents relating to AI may only give a general impression of the overall discussion in each country, goals, financial commitments and timeframes. It would be interesting to link this to actual spending (if such data is available) within the field of artificial intelligence for each given country, although this may be hard (with further limitations).
